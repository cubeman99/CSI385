How to build and run:

 * 'cd' into the main project directory (the one containing this Readme file).
 * Enter the command 'make' to compile and link the code.
   - The object files will be put in the obj/ folder
   - The executable files will be put in the bin/ folder. This includes one for
     the shell and one for each available command.
 * Run executable file 'shell', now located in the bin folder.
   - Enter a command name followed by any arguments.
   - Currently, the possible commands are:
      1. pbs
      2. pfe [X] [Y]
      3. cd [PATH]
      4. pwd
      5. ls [PATH]
      6. exit
   - The commands operate on the file system found in 'disks/floppy2'
